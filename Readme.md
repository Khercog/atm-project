ATM-Project
***********

This is the final project i coded for my final exam of Adv.Programming class. It required to simulate an ATM logic and create hardware components like a Screen and a Keyboard. 
This project is made enterely in JAVA wihtout a DB connection, i used a class to store users data.

It's a basic project but it applys basic OOP concepts and JAVA syntax.

Hope it helps other who are learning.
